%% GENERAL SIMULATION INFO
% If you are simulating the robot with Gazebo, 
% remember that you have to launch Gazebo as follows:
% 
% gazebo -slibgazebo_yarp_clock.so
% 
% and set the environmental variable YARP_ROBOT_NAME = icubGazeboSim.
% To do this, you can uncomment the 

%setenv('YARP_ROBOT_NAME','iCubGenova02');
% % setenv('YARP_ROBOT_NAME','iCubGenova04');
setenv('YARP_ROBOT_NAME','icubGazeboSim');

% estimated as explained above. However, the foot is usually perpendicular
% to gravity when the robot stands on flat surfaces, and rotation about the
% gravity axis may be de to the IMU drift in estimating this angle. Hence,
% when either of the flags CONFIG.YAW_IMU_FILTER or CONFIG.PITCH_IMU_FILTER
% is set to true, then the yaw and/or pitch angles of the contact foot are
% ignored and kept equal to the initial values.
